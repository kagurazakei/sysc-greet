This theme also pairs well with a custom ASCII config using braille-art. See `examples/themes/piink.toml` in the repository.

### Generating Wallpapers

After adding a new theme, regenerate wallpapers to include theme-matched backgrounds:

```bash
cd scripts/
python3 generate-wallpapers.py
```

This creates wallpapers for all themes in `/usr/share/sysc-greet/wallpapers/`. See [Wallpapers](../features/wallpapers.md) for more options.

### Background Effects

Custom themes automatically work with all background effects (fire, matrix, rain, fireworks). The effects generate color palettes from your theme's colors:

- **Fire** uses `bg_base` → `warning` → `danger` → `primary` gradient
- **Matrix** uses `bg_base` → `secondary` → `primary` for the falling characters
- **Rain** uses `primary`, `secondary`, `accent` for the drops
- **Fireworks** uses all accent colors for variety

No additional configuration needed - just select your custom theme and enable an effect.

### TTY Compatibility

sysc-greet uses the `colorprofile` library to detect terminal capabilities and fall back gracefully:

- **TrueColor terminals** - Full 24-bit color support
- **ANSI256 terminals** - 256-color palette support
- **Basic TTY** - Falls back to basic ANSI 16 colors

This ensures consistent appearance across different terminal emulators and TTY.
